For this project, we are interested in exploring any existing correlations between mental health disorder prevalence 
in specific countries and various factors including gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, pollution (CO2 emissions), 
population density, government style, and annual hours of sunshine.

# Research Question:
Based on data from various countries on mental health disorder prevalance and demographic data, can we use a set of 
factors including Gross Domestic Product (GDP), population density, government style, and annual hours of sunshine 
to predict the likelihood of having a mental illness?
